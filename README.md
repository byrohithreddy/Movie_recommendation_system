# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The system leverages a dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie recommendations. It utilizes **pandas** for data manipulation, **NumPy** for numerical computations, and **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the recommendation model.

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and user-friendly recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences or movie similarities.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using pandas.
- Implementation of a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) using scikit-learn.
- Interactive analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebook.
- Modular code structure for easy understanding and extension.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for recommendation.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Movie dataset for training and testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains movie-related information such as titles, genres, ratings, and user interactions. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and formatted for use in the recommendation model.

**Note**: Due to the size of the dataset or licensing, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the relevant Kaggle page (please refer to the notebook for the specific dataset link) and place it in the `data/` folder.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/byrohithreddy/Movie_recommendation_system.git
   cd Movie_recommendation_system


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file includes:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
jupyter


Download the dataset:

Obtain the dataset from Kaggle (refer to the Jupyter Notebook for the specific dataset link).
Place the dataset file(s) in the data/ directory.


Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Open the Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb file in your browser.


Usage

Open the Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train the recommendation model.
Generate movie recommendations.


Modify parameters (e.g., number of recommendations or algorithm type) as needed to experiment with the system.

Future Improvements

Add support for hybrid recommendation algorithms (combining collaborative and content-based filtering).
Implement A/B testing to evaluate different recommendation strategies.
Implement a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.
Incorporate additional datasets for richer recommendations.
Optimize performance for large datasets.
