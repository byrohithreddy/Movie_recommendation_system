# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It leverages a dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system uses **pandas** for data manipulation, **NumPy** for numerical computations, and **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the recommendation model.

The goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences or movie similarities.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning using **pandas**
- Implementation of a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative or content-based filtering) using **scikit-learn**
- Interactive analysis and visualization in **Jupyter Notebook**
- Modular code structure for easy understanding and extension

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment  
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms  
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Movie dataset for training and testing

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and includes information such as:

- Movie titles
- Genres
- Ratings
- User interactions

> 📝 **Note:** Due to size or licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository. You can download it from the relevant Kaggle page (refer to the notebook for the specific dataset link) and place it in the `data/` folder.
