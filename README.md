# 🎮 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It leverages a dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system uses **pandas** for data manipulation, **NumPy** for numerical computations, and **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the recommendation model.

The goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences or movie similarities.

## 🚀 Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning using **pandas**
* Implementation of a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative or content-based filtering) using **scikit-learn**
* Interactive analysis and visualization in **Jupyter Notebook**
* Modular code structure for easy understanding and extension

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
* **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
* **NumPy**: Numerical computations
* **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
* **Kaggle Dataset**: Movie dataset for training and testing

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and includes information such as:

* Movie titles
* Genres
* Ratings
* User interactions

> 📝 **Note:** Due to size or licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository. You can download it from the relevant Kaggle page (refer to the notebook for the specific dataset link) and place it in the `data/` folder.

## ⚙️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/byrohithreddy/Movie_recommendation_system.git
   cd Movie_recommendation_system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   `requirements.txt` includes:

   * pandas
   * numpy
   * scikit-learn
   * jupyter

4. **Download the dataset**:

   * Go to Kaggle and download the dataset (refer to the notebook for the exact link).
   * Place the downloaded file(s) in the `data/` directory.

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   * Open `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` in your browser.

---

## 🧪 Usage

1. Open `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to:

   * Load and preprocess the dataset
   * Train the recommendation model
   * Generate movie recommendations
   * Modify parameters (e.g., number of recommendations or algorithm type) to experiment
